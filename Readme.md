Small examples of HTML5 capabilities.

Some of the examples require some form of webserver to function correctly (my suggestion would be node as you can write your own personal webserver in almost 10 lines or less)

I don't claim they will work for you as they are AS-IS, but ofcourse if I had made a major fault or bug I didn't see please let me know on my website: www.bundgaard.se/bugs (will soon be available)
